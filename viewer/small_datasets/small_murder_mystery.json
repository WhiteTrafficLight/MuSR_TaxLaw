[{"context": "In an adrenaline inducing bungee jumping site, Mack's thrill-seeking adventure came to a gruesome end by a nunchaku; now, it's up to Detective Winston to unravel the deadly secrets between Mackenzie and Ana.\n\nWinston took a gulp of his black coffee, staring at the notes sprawled across his desk. A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today's victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts. \n\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper. \n\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking her questions.\n\n\"Ana, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\" Winston questioned, to which she responded, \"I signed up to jump. But I didn't end up going through with it.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason you didn't join the others, Ana?\" Winston proceeded. \n\nAna took a deep breath, \"Well sir, my faith doesn't really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn't push myself.\"\n\nIt was true \u2013 Mack was insisting that everyone in the group should bungee jump. Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana\u2019s faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\n\n\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\" Winston gently pushed further.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool.\" She responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on her car\u2019s dashboard. Her eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\n\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from her cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\n\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\n\n\"Mackenzie, it is?\" he asked, extending his hand.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\n\n\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know,\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm -- almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded - the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before. \n\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \"Yeah, I was there.\"\n\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?\u201d\n\n\u201cBungee jumping, like Mack\u2026 Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything\u2026\u201d Mackenzie replied.\n\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into. \n\n\u201cMartial arts, huh?\u201d Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie\u2019s knuckles. \u201cNunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?\u201d \n\nThe change in Mackenzie\u2019s demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month\u2019s weather \u2013 dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted, shrinking slightly.\n\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted - the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention - it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead. \n\nWhat clinched it was Mackenzie\u2019s remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack \u2013 all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\n\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report. They were tucked away, but the layer of dust suggested they weren't a favored possession anymore. It wasn\u2019t hidden, it was misplaced \u2013 discarded in the throes of developing maturity.\n\nAs the sun started to set, Winston could see witnesses, scattered across the park, repeatedly pointing to the bungee jumping scaffolding. It occurred to him, then, the narrative of the past days. Mackenzie, jealous and wronged, over and over, at the same sight. It was quite a sight. \n\nWinston, shuffling back to the station, was left with one thought - Looks like Mackenzie had quite an eventful week.", "questions": [{"question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "answer": 0, "choices": ["Mackenzie", "Ana"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "Mackenzie is the murderer.", "children": [{"value": "Mackenzie has a means.", "children": [{"value": "Mackenzie is highly skilled with nunchaku.

He observed Mackenzie through his binoculars, watching closely as they hastily unlocked their front door. It had been a long day at the office for Mackenzie and, like clockwork, they were seen taking their customary break on a public bench, working on their laptop.\n\nBefore long, Mackenzie was seen through the partially closed blinds of their apartment, sitting at their desk with their laptop open. They had just returned from a local cyber security meetup, a reality Winston discovered after following Mackenzie to the event later that evening. As Winston watched, they shifted their body and their eyes darted around, Winston duly noted on Mackenzie's apparent concern for online privacy.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston thought, while making a mental note to do some research on further cyber security meetups occurring in the vicinity.\n\nThe next morning, Winston watched Mackenzie walk out of a martial arts training center. As Mackenzie stopped to say goodbye to their instructor, Winston quickly snapped a photo on his phone. In the picture, Winston could clearly see Mackenzie practicing techniques with the unmistakable form of Mackenzie's sturdy nunchaku resting in the backdrop. This gave Winston a clue that his martial arts training includes nunchaku techniques.\n\nWinston's interest peaked further when he followed Mackenzie to a local shop where they were seen purchasing a new set of nunchaku. Even more intriguing was when they examined a pair of cufflinks on display with a yearning look, cufflinks Winston knew were identical to a pair Mack frequently flaunted around. It appeared Mack had things that Mackenzie also desired.\n\nThe investigator decided it was time to pay Mackenzie a visit. He knocked on the apartment door and Mackenzie cautiously invited him in.\n\nPleasantries were briefly exchanged before Winston's gaze quickly fell on the laptop that was resting by some papers next to an open window.\n\n\"You always take this with you to work?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the laptop.\n\n\"Every day,\" Mackenzie replied, \"I can't leave my work at the office.\"\n\n\"Work goes that well, huh?\" Winston probed further. \"I hear you were recently ... overlooked for a promotion.\"\n\nAt these words, Mackenzie's expression darkened. \"I was the top candidate, you know. It should've been mine. Mack, the new guy, he is nothing compared to me, but he takes it. That promotion, the respect I had. Even those cufflinks I have always wanted, somehow Mack always gets to have them.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Mackenzie's reaction. They turned the conversation to martial arts and during the chat, Mackenzie unintentionally revealed their prowess with nunchaku.\n\nIn a small, hidden compartment in Mackenzie's wardrobe, Winston found the pair of nunchaku that Mackenzie had recently purchased. He swiftly snapped a picture of this evidence before closing the wardrobe.\n\nAs the day grew late, Winston thanked Mackenzie for their time and headed out, feeling more certain than ever about the path his investigation was following.", "used_chapter": "The day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down.

The lack of clues at the murder site puzzled him, nothing seemed out of place. All he had was an unusual weapon, the nunchaku, not something he\u2019d found at too many crime scenes.\n\nStanding up, he straightened his tie and headed to the shared housing complex of the victim and suspect. Ana Diaz lived here, along with Mack. Ground rules for questioning the suspect were laid out in his mind.\n\nAna received him with a stoic expression and invited him inside. Her suitcase was unpacked, strewn helter-skelter around the room. She explained she had come back from the bungee jumping site late last night, still in shock about Mack\u2019s murder.\n\nNunchaku lay on the table. Winston noticed, she explained it as the normal household item of a martial artist. She said she practices martial arts at the same bungee jumping location. \n\nAsked about their shared occupation, she sighed heavily. \u201cMack loved it, though,\" She said, \"He was the instigator, insisting everyone take the jump.\u201d\n\nAna seemed to soften, talking about her faith, her traditions. \u201cBungee jumping, it's against my beliefs,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019d signed up too, expecting some ridicule like always.\u201d\n\nRidicule. That was a word Winston had already heard before concerning Mack. He asked around, among their friends, everyone said the same, Mack liked to joke, to point fun at beliefs. Especially Ana\u2019s it seemed.\n\nThey left together, Ana and Mack, the morning of the murder, people had seen them. Winston asked why, given their strained relationship. Ana shrugged off, her hands trembling. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t too bad,\u201d she replied. \n\nNobody else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, only Mack and Ana. It was time to head there. Winston thanked Ana for her time and left, driving straight to the scene. He stared up at the looming diving board, picturing the scene.  \n\nOnly two people there that day, Mack and Ana. He looked around, the martial arts practice ground nearby held the last piece. Nunchaku, a common weapon in martial arts practices. He tested one, the weight fitting neatly into his palm while he surveyed the area. This was the scene he needed to piece together.", "innocent_chapter": "Winston took a gulp of his black coffee, staring at the notes sprawled across his desk.

Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper. \n\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod.

The air was heavy with the scent of fresh coffee and the clamour of a bustling restaurant kitchen. His eyes fell on a seasoned chef, Rosemary, as she deftly wielded her bladed tools \u2014 knives, cleavers, graters \u2014 with calm precision. Watching her, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\n\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\n\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\n\nShe gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\n\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\n\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over her face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\n\n\"A public event, not long ago. You spoke openly about your, um-\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\" he pressed on, \"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\"\n\n\"Is that a crime, detective?\" Rosemary challenged.\n\n\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\n\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\n\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\n\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\n\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\n\n\"Harry, correct?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"And who's asking?\" came the guarded reply.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he flashed his badge, \"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\"\n\nHarry's eyes flashed, \"I'm not surprised,\" he grumbled. \"Come on in then.\"\n\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\n\n\"Nice collection.\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \"You instruct?\"\n\nHarry looked back at the sai, \"Used to.\"\n\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\n\n\"Got dealt a bad hand?\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \n\nHarry grunted, \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\n\n\"Got into any recent arguments?\" Winston asked.\n\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.\u201d\n\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\n\n\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\n\nHarry's face stiffened, \"He needed money\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\n\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \"Just one last thing, Harry,\" Winston queried, \"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\"\n\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \"Used to spend a lot of time there.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers.

His keen eye caught sight of the security camera footage playing at the front desk \u2013 it clearly showed Harry walking into the casino just moments before the tragic murder occurred. He wove his way quickly through the crowd towards his destination \u2013 the inner edge of the casino. This secluded corner, often frequented by high rollers, was a crime scene tonight, cordoned off with police tape. Harry, a well-established horse trainer, knew this particular corner all too well.\n\nWinston found Harry standing at the periphery of the scene, alone, seemingly lost in thought. A few onlookers nearby whispered about a heated argument they had witnessed between Harry and Timothy earlier in the night in this very corner.\n\n\"Harry,\" the detective started, as the recognized face turned to meet him, \"Been a while since you've stepped foot in a martial arts tournament, eh?\"\n\nHarry grunted. He wasn't surprised. After all, he was a well-decorated martial arts champion, with several competition victories under his belt. \"In another life, maybe,\" he grumbled. \n\nLiving in the busy business district full of martial arts schools including his own, he had once been a revered martial arts instructor, imparting his knowledge of a specific style \u2013 one where the sai was a commonly used weapon \u2013 to his students. Daily practice with a sai was part of his routine for years. \n\n\"I heard about your argument with Timothy tonight,\" Winston continued, \"Right here in the corner where our poor victim was found, Harry.\" He gestured towards the cordoned area, then back at Harry. The horse trainer stiffened slightly, but nodded all the same as the reality of questioning sank in. \"I was spotted in the footage, wasn't I?\" he muttered, the deep-seated gambling debt he owed Timothy sketched visible worry lines on his face.\n\n\"As part of our ongoing investigations, we've been checking the security camera footage from the casino,\" Winston explained. \"Interestingly, you're seen entering the place just before the murder.\"\n\nOverhearing their conversation, a staff member chuckled softly before adding, \"He walked in and called John at the front desk, introducing himself as 'Bill'. Then shortly after, he asked Sara, our bartender for a drink, mentioning his name was 'Tom'. Quite the prankster!\"\n\n\"Just a little game I play, Detective,\" Harry said, with a hint of a smile on his face.\n\nThey both looked back at the staff member. He shrugged and gave them a knowing smile, reminding Winston of the gamble-loving spirit he was dealing with \u2014 a spirit that left its fingerprints all over the casino's registration documents. \n\nAs Winston walked away from Harry, he pondered on the debt, the aliases, the martial arts background, and the turning wheel of possibilities in his investigation.

The victim was Timothy, a man of Chinese heritage, which made the crime scene, a luxurious casino, all the more odd. The murder weapon had been identified as a sai, an exotic Asian weapon. He clicked his pen as he checked all the facts and considered the evidence, including the recorded threats indicating a racial bias that Rosemary had once voiced against Timothy.\n\nHis first stop was the buzzing casino kitchen where a woman with a steely gaze ran the show. Rosemary, the head chef, had fifty years of culinary experience and was known for her hardened palm and commanding presence.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" she began, extending her aged hand in greeting. \"Is this about Timothy?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" replied the detective, accepting her firm hand. \"Tell me, Rosemary, did you leave the kitchen yesterday evening? There seems to be no one who can account for your whereabouts around the time of the murder.\"\n\n\"No, I was here all night,\u201d she stated firmly. \u201cI was busy with dinner service. Ask anyone present, they'll vouch for me.\" The confirmation allowed Winston to check off another fact on his list: no one saw Rosemary leave the kitchen at the time of the murder.\n\nWinston moved past her alibi and onto a subject that intrigued him. \"Rosemary, I understand you have an appreciation for Asian culture and a collection of antique weapons. Is this accurate?\"\n\nWith a brief flash of suspicion, she responded. \"I do, yes. I have sais, katanas, you name it.\"\n\n\"And Timothy, was he dining here last night? At this casino you work at?\" Winston questioned, making sure every fact on his list was thoroughly checked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rosemary confirmed. \"He was a guest at our private dining area.\"\n\nSo Timothy was dining in the casino at the time of his murder, just as the information had led Winston to believe.\n\nShifting his glance between the various bladed tools in the kitchen and Rosemary, Winston broached the topic that had made local news. \"Rosemary,\" he began, a stern expression on his face, \"there was a public event where you voiced your disdain for Chinese people, any explanation for your behavior?\"\n\nCaught off guard, she fumbled through her words. \"That... that was just a misunderstanding,\" she stuttered, her gaze faltering.\n\n\"Then how do you explain the recorded conversation where you've stated your dislike for Timothy on the grounds of his ethnicity?\" Winston shot back, crossing his arms.\n\nRosemary sighed, her face wrinkling with frustration. \"Sure, Timothy and I didn't get along. We had disagreements during his dinner visit last night...\"\n\nShaking off her nostalgic gaze, Winston pressed on, \"Any threats?\u201d\n\n\"Well,\" she sighed again, \"there were times when I was too angry... I admit threatening him, Detective.\u201d\n\nWinston\u2019s gaze was unbreaking as he finally responded, \"Well, we'll just have to see about that.\" With that, he turned, exiting the hustle of the kitchen behind him.", "innocent_chapter": "It had been a long day for Winston.

Watching her, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\n\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\n\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\n\nShe gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\n\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\n\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over her face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\n\n\"A public event, not long ago.

Emma, a nurse, introduced herself as the sister of the victim, Daniel. To those present-- mainly strangers, she was a new face. Interestingly enough, she made sure to gracefully ask everyone their names. Among the crowd were Daniel's family, whom she met for the first time that day, despite his prolonged treatment at the hospital. This was an unusual circumstance Winston noted down.\n\nHuman tears could be telling. Winston, having seen more than his fair share of grieving families and friends, noticed that Emma's display during Daniel's funeral was peculiar. Hers were the only eyes that were excessively wet, her crying far more pronounced than anyone else present. It intrigued him that despite this overwhelming show of emotion, nobody from the grieving family seemed to recognize her.\n\n\"Emma was in charge of Daniel's care,\" Hannah, an admin worker at the hospital, provided when Winston sought better understanding of Emma's relationship to the victim. As she spoke, Winston noted down in his leather-bound notebook that Emma was responsible for Daniel's daily schedule due to her duties.\n\nHannah then identified Emma from a picture Winston slid across the table. \"That's her. She's the one who organized that zoo trip for Daniel. His upbeat demeanor that day... He was having such a good time away from the hospital.\" Hannah pausing to reflect brought further solemnity to the memory of that day when Daniel's body, and a syringe from their hospital, was found at the zoo.\n\nAs Winston visited Emma's residence, her life as a nurse was exhibited by the random nursing memorabilia discarded around the apartment; badges, maps of the hospital wards, even Daniel's daily schedule calendar. \n\nEmma's career in medicine wasn't surprising, given her fascination with the field. She was a nurse at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving her unrestricted access to his room among others. While her chosen path was understandable, it did make this case more convoluted than the usual ones Winston had come across. As things were unfolding, Emma seemed like she could be a guardian angel... or perhaps a devil in disguise. Winston would have to tread on this puzzle with utmost care.\n\nWinston pored over the crime scene photos spread haphazardly across his desk. Daniel's body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\n\nDaniel had been at Amelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\n\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\n\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia. \n\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\n\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\n\n\"Good afternoon, detective,\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\" she added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\n\nWinston nodded in response. \"Set up here often, Amelia?\" he asked, taking a seat.\n\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \"When the occasion calls for it, yes.\"\n\n\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\" Winston continued.\n\nAmelia paused before confirming. \"Yes, he was.\"\n\n\"Have any idea why he was at the zoo today?\" Winston asked.\n\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \"No idea, detective.\"\n\n\"One last question,\" Winston said. \"How well're you acquainted with syringes, Amelia?\"\n\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something you're implying, detective?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder. He stood up, thanked her then left, knowing she would be closing alone, just like every other night at her bar. Alone during closing, just as it had always been.

Daniel's body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\n\nDaniel had been at Amelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\n\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\n\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia. \n\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\n\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\n\n\"Good afternoon, detective,\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\" she added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\n\nWinston nodded in response. \"Set up here often, Amelia?\" he asked, taking a seat.\n\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \"When the occasion calls for it, yes.\"\n\n\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\" Winston continued.\n\nAmelia paused before confirming. \"Yes, he was.\"\n\n\"Have any idea why he was at the zoo today?\" Winston asked.\n\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \"No idea, detective.\"\n\n\"One last question,\" Winston said. \"How well're you acquainted with syringes, Amelia?\"\n\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something you're implying, detective?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder. He stood up, thanked her then left, knowing she would be closing alone, just like every other night at her bar. Alone during closing, just as it had always been. Winston returned to his desk, itching closer to understanding what had happened to Daniel.", "innocent_chapter": "Winston gingerly stepped into the blurry morning light. His first port of call, the infamous Zoo where Daniel's life was abruptly cut short. As he made his way past the monkey enclosure, a bright red hat peeked out from a treetop. Daniel's hat. No doubt he had been here, but what was he doing in the primate area?\n\nWinston took a step back and scanned the area. His gaze fell upon the makeshift wooden bar tucked away by the corner. That's when he noticed Amelia setting up her bar, placing various liquor bottles in their places, stacking the glasses precisely in her own thirsty manner. Amelia, the bartender from the watering hole Daniel frequented, had begun her day at the zoo early that morning. \n\nSuddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed before Winston's eyes. He remembered seeing Daniel, chatty and jovial as ever at Amelia's bar. This was before the incident, before the silence surrounded by chaos. \n\nWith determined steps, Winston hurried over to Amelia's regular bar in the city. As he walked in, he observed the familiar locale. The cracks in the wall, the faded posters. The painting hanging on the wall of Amelia's home was exactly the same. A violent brawl depicted in the same bar, reflecting Amelia's artistic license in her paintings. A perfect replica of the bar, complete with each minute crack in the wall was stroked with such precision that it sent a shiver down his spine. Amelia, an artist by morning, illustrating the violence that would occur by night.\n\nAll of a sudden, a piercing screech emanated from a nearby enclosure. Winston, startled, quickly turned around and realized it was lunchtime at the zoo. Staff were feeding the animals. Among the staff was Amelia, wielding a small syringe, proficiently sedating an agitated monkey. Winston drew a sharp breath, recalling her proficiency with syringes, the odd weapon of choice in Daniel's murder.\n\nAmelia noticed the detective at nearly the same instant and walked over. Her spunky red hair tied back into a ponytail, her bright green eyes challenging him. Amelia wasn't your typical bartender.  \n\"Brings you quite early today, Winston? Can I get you something to drink?\" Amelia smirked, avoiding any informative conversation. \n\n\"Was Daniel here yesterday?\" Winston probed, ignoring her question. \n\n\"Sure, he got in around the afternoon.\" Amelia paused, glancing at the post-midday sun. \"Anything else you want to?\",\nWinston decided to dig a bit more, \"What time did you close last night, Amelia? Any company?\"\n\n\"Late, as always. I'm alone after hours, you know.\" Amelia shrugged carelessly as she took a small canvas out from behind the bar counter, ready to continue her post-work painting ritual.\n\nAmelia, the artist who moonlighted as a bartender, and a skillful one at that. Winston thought to himself. She defensively guarded her solitary space, applying her painting skills onto canvas after hours, but one whose depictions were less than tranquil.\n\nWith his visit done, Winston tipped his hat off to Amelia and moved on for the day, leaving a nervous bartender in her wake.\n", "used_chapter": "Winston pored over the crime scene photos spread haphazardly across his desk. Daniel's body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\n\nDaniel had been at Amelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\n\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\n\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia. \n\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\n\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\n\n\"Good afternoon, detective,\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\" she added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\n\nWinston nodded in response. \"Set up here often, Amelia?\" he asked, taking a seat.\n\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \"When the occasion calls for it, yes.\"\n\n\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\" Winston continued.\n\nAmelia paused before confirming. \"Yes, he was.\"\n\n\"Have any idea why he was at the zoo today?\" Winston asked.\n\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \"No idea, detective.\"\n\n\"One last question,\" Winston said. \"How well're you acquainted with syringes, Amelia?\"\n\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something you're implying, detective?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder. He stood up, thanked her then left, knowing she would be closing alone, just like every other night at her bar. Alone during closing, just as it had always been.

These didn't belong to any doctor, but were registered to a nurse called Emma, interestingly, the sister of the victim, Daniel.\n\n\"Always had a knack for playing nurse,\" said a neighbor when Winston asked about Emma. \"From a young age, she was determined to study medicine.\"\n\nHowever, her medical history was not as clean as expected. Winston discovered Emma had defended herself in a lawsuit regarding medical misconduct. It appeared her passion for medicine wasn't enough to cleanse her record.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Emma's workplace. Emma seemed to run the show there, in charge of taking care of numerous patients, one of them being her brother, Daniel. She had unlimited access to both patient rooms and supplies, owing to her profession.\n\nAfter Daniel fell ill, Emma had taken over his day-to-day care. Winston observed the level of meticulousness in her work, seen in the daily schedules she maintained for Daniel, providing an insight into his routine.\n\nA closer inspection of the documents revealed certain falsifications in the medical entries. Emma\u2019s writing gave her away as the one who manipulated these records.\n\nDaniel was scheduled to testify at court, a fact evident through multiple subpoenas discovered at his residence. The case was against his own sister, Emma, in relation to medical malpractice. Winston made a note of the court date; it was unnervingly close. His hunch said that this information was not to be disregarded.\n\nEmma was the one who planned out the trip to the zoo, Winston found. A visit to the zoo was calming therapy for her bed-ridden brother... at least it usually.\n\nWinston could still envision the terrible scene at the zoo where Daniel had been found lifeless, an eerie death brought on by a medical syringe. Nothing in the vicinity suggested the presence of a murderer except for a couple of eyewitnesses who had spotted Emma around the same time as the murder.\n\nHis last stop was the hospital, where he bumped into Emma finishing her shift. Daniel had been under her care at this very facility. It was clear to Winston that the system trusted her and she held sway in her workplace. \n\nWinston had more questions but he left them for another day. The facts had certainly pointed him to interesting possibilities that had to be pursued diligently. It was a murder that he could sense ran deeper than it appeared.", "innocent_chapter": "Detective Winston stood in the waiting room of the hospital where Emma was employed, eyes flitting between the familiar faces of staff.

Interestingly enough, she made sure to gracefully ask everyone their names. Among the crowd were Daniel's family, whom she met for the first time that day, despite his prolonged treatment at the hospital. This was an unusual circumstance Winston noted down.\n\nHuman tears could be telling. Winston, having seen more than his fair share of grieving families and friends, noticed that Emma's display during Daniel's funeral was peculiar. Hers were the only eyes that were excessively wet, her crying far more pronounced than anyone else present. It intrigued him that despite this overwhelming show of emotion, nobody from the grieving family seemed to recognize her.\n\n\"Emma was in charge of Daniel's care,\" Hannah, an admin worker at the hospital, provided when Winston sought better understanding of Emma's relationship to the victim. As she spoke, Winston noted down in his leather-bound notebook that Emma was responsible for Daniel's daily schedule due to her duties.\n\nHannah then identified Emma from a picture Winston slid across the table. \"That's her. She's the one who organized that zoo trip for Daniel. His upbeat demeanor that day... He was having such a good time away from the hospital.\" Hannah pausing to reflect brought further solemnity to the memory of that day when Daniel's body, and a syringe from their hospital, was found at the zoo.\n\nAs Winston visited Emma's residence, her life as a nurse was exhibited by the random nursing memorabilia discarded around the apartment; badges, maps of the hospital wards, even Daniel's daily schedule calendar. \n\nEmma's career in medicine wasn't surprising, given her fascination with the field. She was a nurse at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving her unrestricted access to his room among others.

Serenity, the star wrestler, had publicly threatened her opponent, Terrance. And Terrance, poor lad, was found pale and trembling after their match. Terrance was no stranger to the grit and physicality of ranch life, but the wrestling ring was another story entirely. He had been in the losing end of a previous matchup with Serenity. \n\nFinally placated by the caffeine and recalling his purpose, Winston trudged to the boots and scruff leather of the local ranch. He was greeted by the sight of Terrance coordinating his ranch work, his sun-worn skin a testament to long hours under the warm Texan sun. \"You're Terrance I suppose?\" Winston asked, as he gestured to the flourishing land around them.\n\n\"That'd be me, Detective,\" Terrance replied in a thick southern drawl. \"This land's been around longer than I have. Been a rancher all my life.\"\n\nThere was an odd sense of hitched anxiety when Winston brought up the chainsaw classes he'd heard Terrance attended. \"Gotta know how to operatin' it,\" Terrance replied. \"Helps keepin' the place run smooth.\"\n\nWinston hustled over to where the recent wrestling match had taken place. It was a local tradition in the town and Terrance was no stranger to it, being a regular sponsor. It was a sweltering evening when he found himself at the scene, their wrestling ring splattered with the remnants of what occurred.\n\nReturning to the station under the glow of disjointed neon lights, Winston on a hunch asked a few local attendees about the particular wrestling match where Serenity was killed. Terrance was in the crowd that night, cheering heatedly during the match.\n\nIn a more relaxed visit to the local bar, Terrance appeared more forthright. \"She was strong, Detective. Really strong,\" Terrance eased into his confession after a few sips of his drink. At another instance, in a low murmured admission to some friends, Terrance had been heard saying he felt threatened by Serenity. There were rumors around of Terrance being seen frequently repairing a chainsaw. The very same chainsaw Terrance learned to operate, and the chilling instrument that ended Serenity's life.\n\nFor now, this was the puzzle Winston had to unravel. He gave Terrance a long, discerning look over the rim of his beer glass before leaving the lightly crowded bar. On his way out, the words of a recent reports echoed in his head, \u201cA chainsaw is essential in ranch work\u2026\u201d\n\nWinston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired \u2013 an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\n\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter and prime suspect in the case, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that he directly employed in his painting procedures, forming part of his job. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\n\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that his chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. He would often proclaim that shaping wood using his chainsaw was an integral part of his painting role. His proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired his work for its notable woodsiness.\n\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files. His data seemed to have been deliberately wiped out, prompting Winston to question their collective avoidance in discussing Nelson.\n\nWinston then moved to his final stop, Nelson's quaint bungalow. Unusually quiet and still with the curtains tightly drawn; not the usual sight, as reported by neighbors who mentioned Nelson's affection for painting under natural light. Winston learned that Nelson had ceased attending the weekly game nights at the local pub, coinciding with his new preference for drawn curtains.\n\nAs Winston introspected leaning against his car, he realized the significance of the patterns in the changing behaviors of the painter. Winston was now confident that Nelson indeed had a strong motive in Serenity's demise \u2013 albeit, this was supported by an eerie amalgamation of evidence: the drawn curtains, the nonattendance at the pub, the wiped data, the unusual termination, and finally, his habitual, ominous use of chainsaws. \n\nTime was ticking away, and Winston was now more determined than ever. He drove away from Nelson\u2019s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and his last works that haunted his thoughts. The presentiment of the forthcoming day, the hunt for more truths and the justice for Serenity, was overwhelming. Each passing hour made the air heavier with unspoken truths, and Winston was resolute to unthread them all.", "questions": [{"question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "answer": 0, "choices": ["Terrance", "Nelson"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "Terrance is the murderer.", "children": [{"value": "Terrance has a means.", "children": [{"value": "Terrance owns several chainsaws as part of his ranching equipment.

The autopsy report he had been waiting on arrived. The time of death was the same as the time when a wrestling match was taking place.\n\nTerrance was Winston's main point of interest. A local rancher and sponsor of the wrestling matches, he had been cheering loudly in the crowd during that fatal match. Connecting the dots, Winston knew he had to speak to Terrance.\n\nApproaching the ranch, Winston noticed Terrance ear-deep in a chainsaw, his broad shoulders turning to reveal a modern television flickering in the living room. The news was running in the background, a constant source of information for the socially inept rancher.\n\n\"Hiya, detective,\" Terrance greeted him with a friendly pat. \"Anything I can do you for?\" \n\n\"Just a few questions,\" Winston answered. \"Heard you were at the wrestling ring during the match.\" \n\n\"Yep, I was,\" he said cheerfully. \"Half the town was there. Good match.\"\n\nWinston decided to change the topic. \"Nice TV you got there,\" he said casually, eyeing the flickering screen tuned to the local news.\n\n\"Oh yeah, not much for those Internet-fangled gadgets though. I got Cole always telling me to try out social media, but I can't be arsed to,\" Terrance said, shaking his head with a chuckle. \"He even sent me screenshots of how to set up a Facebook account. Can you believe that?\"\n\n\"That so?\" Winston said with a small smile. \"Your chainsaw, I heard you've been working on it.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah!\" Terrance nodded. \"Farm life, you know. Can't go too far without needing a chainsaw. Even took some classes on how to operate it. Can't just wing those things, y'know what I mean?\"\n\nWinston didn't respond to his comment immediately, allowing the rancher's words to hang in the air as he mentally noted his next steps in this investigation.", "used_chapter": "Winston mused over his coffee cup, squinting at his notes from last night's wrestling match.

An old Art-dealer turned painter named Nelson, rumored to want the land where the wrestling territory lay for his next project, was his next interviewee. Winston was a practical man, but he couldn't deny that Nelson's paintings \u2013 mostly featuring wood cut in intricate details \u2013 were anything less than art.\n\n\"Morning Detective, it's my pleasure to finally meet ya,\" Nelson greeted him as he entered the studio. \n\n\"Good morning, Nelson,\" Winston replied, glancing around the room. There in the corner stood a chainsaw, paint splattered and well used. Noticing Winston's gaze, Nelson explained, \"I've been practicing with it almost daily.\"\n\nIt was part of an artist\u2019s kit and Nelson voiced the same, \"Yes sir, that there helps me with these intricate designs, ya see?\"\n\nWinston continued to scan the room, making small conversation, \"You use this in all your paintings?\" \n\n\"Most of them,\" Nelson replied, \"It gives 'em character.\"\n\n\"I see... and it looks like you've had quite a bit of practice with it,\" Winston said nonchalantly, earning a nod from Nelson. \n\n\"Oh yes, it's part of the job, you know?\" Nelson replied.\n\nDuring his investigation, Winston caught sight of a miniature wrestling ring and ticket stubs from various wrestling matches. Nelson indeed had a keen interest in wrestling, having both attended and participated in past wrestling events. His reminders of the matches extended so far as to include the recent wrestling match Nelson attended where the tragic murder of Serenity had occurred.\n\n\"I'm sure you heard about what happened to Serenity at the wrestling match - the same one you were present at?\" Winston asked. \n\n\"Yes. Terrible thing, what happened. She was a great talent,\" Nelson replied with an almost convincing sadness, leaving Winston to consider the motives of a man who could potentially gain from her demise.\n\nWinston thanked him for his time and, as he walked away, he glanced one last time at the chainsaw and Nelson\u2019s paintings. The next stage of the investigation beckoned him, yet he couldn\u2019t shake off the details of this encounter just yet.", "innocent_chapter": "Winston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired \u2013 an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\n\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter and prime suspect in the case, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that he directly employed in his painting procedures, forming part of his job. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\n\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that his chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. He would often proclaim that shaping wood using his chainsaw was an integral part of his painting role. His proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired his work for its notable woodsiness.\n\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files.

He drove away from Nelson\u2019s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and his last works that haunted his thoughts.

The mystery of Kent's death was still lingering, and it had become clear that he had to delve further into the details than anticipated.\n\nWalking into the complex building, the detective stopped outside the Herpetarium where Julia currently worked. Julia once mentioned offhandedly, \"I trained as a herpetologist, that's my background.\" He stared at the array of snakes - some small, some dangerously large, but all housed carefully in glass terrariums. Julia was in the midst of handling one of the sizeable serpents, its scales reflecting the light in an almost hypnotic way.\n\n\"Julia?\" He questioned, gaining her attention.\n\n\"That's me,\" she affirmed, gently placing the snake back into its tank.\n\n\"Mind if we talk a moment?\"\n\n\"I've got nothing to hide,\" the woman replied as she led him back behind her desk, scattered with numerous manuals and books about programming and tech innovations. A receptionist's post-it came from nowhere and stuck to her palm, \"Remember: Staff Meeting. Introduce Julia \u2013 New Software Engineer.\" She rolled her eyes and said, \"I'm now working as a software engineer.\" An out-of-place office notification chimed and she shrugged.\n\n\"Did you know about the info posted on the company's Facebook page yesterday?\" He asked. She shook her head, adding, \"I never keep up with that. Too busy with my work, you see. Truthfully, I don't even have a Facebook account of my own.\"\n\n\"Do you visit the mosque nearby?\" He questioned. She nodded. \n\n\"Why, yes, I do. I was there with my cousin Kent the same day before...\" her voice wavered. \"We had a disagreement. People saw us arguing,\" she added.\n\nShe escorted Winston to her home soon after, where a vial of snake venom sat on her coffee table.\n\n\"Why do you have that?\" He asked, looking at the vial but careful not to touch.\n\n\"I work with venomous snakes, detective,\" she said, a matter of factly tone threading her voice. \"Research.\" \n\nThey had coffee in silence after that. Interesting, he thought as he left her house. He had a lot more work to do.\n\nAs Winston tied his shoe, a fellow cop whistled. He didn\u2019t need to look up to know what was coming up next.\n\n\"Did you know snake venom can be lethal?\" said the officer as he stepped aside to let a group of zookeepers from the local zoo, renowned for its variety of venomous snakes, carry a large reticulated python past.\n\n\"Yeah, interesting creatures, snakes,\" replied Winston without breaking stride. He continued toward the office door where a zoo security guard profile was awaiting him, the guard whose shift happened to line up with the time of the Kent's death at the mosque.\n\nAs he was flipping through the guard\u2019s file, he noticed the man\u2019s name, Ronald. He was a unique type of security, it seems - besides patrolling the mosque during prayer hours, he also worked at the zoo, and one of his main duties involved handling the zoo's assortment of dangerous animals, including venomous snakes. God knows there were too many types of them at that zoo.\n\nHis phone rang. It was the Imam.\n\n\"Detective Winston, Kent was here for prayers daily, he was very religious,\" he said when Winston picked up.\n\nWinston thanked the Imam and hung up, then got up and headed to the mosque. Ronald worked during prayer hours which meant he could've seen Kent arriving or leaving.\n\nKent was there pretty much every day. There was no way for Ronald to miss seeing Kent on his death day.\n\nAfter arriving at the mosque, Winston saw Ronald standing guard. He prepared himself for the hard part of his job - accusations and denials.\n\n\"Ronald, we found these,\" Winston showed Ronald the documents found in Kent's possession. The paperwork portrayed previous indictments, some acquittals, some convictions. Ronald's entire criminal record laid bare on papers.\n\n\"What the hell do you want?\" Ronald's face turned red, and he grunted vehemently. \"I have nothing to do with those papers!\"\n\nKnowing better, Winston didn't continue this line of questioning and instead took a more amiable approach. \"So, you are also a snake keeper at the zoo, Ronald?\"\n\nRonald's red face softened, and he seemed slightly less tense. \"Yes, I do. I have the keys to all the enclosures, from the common rattlesnakes to the deadly cobras.\" Maybe it was the change of topic, maybe it was the sense of the authority that these keys brought him, but Ronald was less defensive now.\n\nWinston nodded, thanked Ronald for his time, then turned his back towards him, leaving Ronald alone with the darkening facade of the mosque and a bag of anxiety.", "questions": [{"question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "answer": 0, "choices": ["Ronald", "Julia"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "Ronald is the murderer.", "children": [{"value": "Ronald has a means.", "children": [{"value": "Ronald understands the lethality of snake venom.

Winston fished the statement reports from his pile of case files, which stated that Kent and Julia were last seen together at the mosque.  Kent had been poisoned with snake venom, a tricky murder weapon to trace. His victim, Kent, was Julia's cousin and had last been seen at the mosque with her before he met his unfortunate fate.\n\nHis next stop was clear. He pulled his coat close against the biting wind and snow. Silicon Valley, estate of one Julia. Inside, he found Julia embroiled in what seemed an exhaustive pile of legal documents. From their exchange, he learned that she was currently tangled up in a knotty lawsuit, where the opposing party had a good deal to gain, financially that is.\n\nStepping into what he could only describe as a mini laboratory, a brave new world peered back at him. Labeled samples cluttered the table, one of which was a snake venom sample. Julia was trained as a herpetologist and her job involved working with venomous snakes, she explained this to Winston while also showing him her work with venomous snakes.\n\nAs they moved past countless terrariums, Winston paused in front of a portrait on the mantel. \u201cThat\u2019s Kent,\u201d Julia sighed. \u201cAlways the favored one, especially by Grandpa. In his latest will, everything was left to him. The will was initially expected to be in my favor, but, he bypassed me completely,\" Julia said. Her voice turned bitter as she revealed these shocking discoveries about her cousin, Kent.\n\nChanging the topic to something less contentious, she mentioned that both of them used to frequent the same mosque for prayers, the very place where Kent was last seen alive by people, before she added, \"And we were together at the mosque that same day.\" Her tone hardened as she described an altercation with Kent she had had earlier that day at the mosque. The tension was palpable as she revealed her own cousin had been secretly helping the opposition in the ongoing legal battle.\n\nWinston nodded, took a few final notes, and bid his farewell, a gust of wind blowing in with the opening of the front door. His footsteps crunched the snow beneath his boots and the stark contrast of his solitary car in the vast white providence painted an odd yet mystic picture. As he drove off, the silhouette of Julia\u2019s house receded, but the flicker of suspicion stayed kindled in his mind.", "innocent_chapter": "Winston parked outside the museum, wiping a sweat off his brow as he observed the row of windows facing the parking lot. The mystery of Kent's death was still lingering, and it had become clear that he had to delve further into the details than anticipated.\n\nWalking into the complex building, the detective stopped outside the Herpetarium where Julia currently worked. Julia once mentioned offhandedly, \"I trained as a herpetologist, that's my background.\" He stared at the array of snakes - some small, some dangerously large, but all housed carefully in glass terrariums. Julia was in the midst of handling one of the sizeable serpents, its scales reflecting the light in an almost hypnotic way.\n\n\"Julia?\" He questioned, gaining her attention.\n\n\"That's me,\" she affirmed, gently placing the snake back into its tank.\n\n\"Mind if we talk a moment?\"\n\n\"I've got nothing to hide,\" the woman replied as she led him back behind her desk, scattered with numerous manuals and books about programming and tech innovations.

Truthfully, I don't even have a Facebook account of my own.\"\n\n\"Do you visit the mosque nearby?\" He questioned. She nodded. \n\n\"Why, yes, I do.

People saw us arguing,\" she added.\n\nShe escorted Winston to her home soon after, where a vial of snake venom sat on her coffee table.\n\n\"Why do you have that?\" He asked, looking at the vial but careful not to touch.\n\n\"I work with venomous snakes, detective,\" she said, a matter of factly tone threading her voice. \"Research.\" \n\nThey had coffee in silence after that.

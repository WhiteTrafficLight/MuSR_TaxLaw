[{"context": "In the heart of the bustling studio, Ricky, Emma, and Danny readied themselves for a day of creating magic. Ricky, holding the helm as the gifted singer-songwriter, was poised for perfection, his precious notebook of lyrics awaiting its call to duty on the producer's desk. Emma, their dutiful and talented producer, was just as eager to breathe life into Ricky's lyrics. She was cognizant of the notebook's place at her desk, awaiting the melodies they would cultivate together.\n\nAcross the room, Danny, the diligent studio assistant, was doing his due diligence, keeping the earphones nestled in the recording booth. His aim was to ensure an optimized and meticulous environment for recording, a testament to his commitment to their shared mission. They were all aware of the arrangement \u2014 the notebook on the producer's desk, the earphones in the recording booth. Their shared consciousness of these items only intensified the anticipation; they were eager to turn the contents of a weathered notebook into a world-class album.\n\nRicky, with his weathered notebook of potent lyrics in hand, gently places it onto the piano. An air of creativity and anticipation lingers in the room, everyone aware that this was the first instrumental step in the creation of their masterpiece. In sync with the palpable creative energy, Ricky was engrossed in perfecting the rhythm of his song, preparing himself for an intense day ahead. Not too far away, Emma was sincerely engrossed in her role of musically steering the session. She was focussed on Ricky\u2019s progress, her eyes constantly monitoring him and her mind alive with ideas to enhance the music. \n\nMeanwhile, Danny was diligently covering every corner of the studio. He was making his rounds, ensuring that the studio was prim and proper for Ricky\u2019s crucial session. As part of his tasks, he passed by Ricky several times, always careful not to interrupt the artist's flow.\n\n\nEmma, engrossed in her thoughts, deftly moves the earphones to the producer's desk. She is preparing to tweak the sound settings, pre-empting Ricky's need for perfect audio in his performance. Diverting from his rounds, Danny found himself in the midst of a stirring conversation with a visiting sound engineer. Knowledge flowed between them, illuminating the studio's atmosphere, the engineer's insight bringing a new perspective into Danny's role. Ricky, ensconced in his own world, was in deep discussion with the blank page before him. The daunting silence of the empty studio buzzed with his focus, as he honed his lyrics to perfection in a space separate from the producer's. The visitor, oblivious to the careful choreography of the studio session, stood blocking Danny's general overview of the studio space.\n\nDelicately lifting Ricky's notebook, Danny orchestrates its move to the producer's desk. At the desk, he glimpses a pair of earphones indirectly drawing his attention amidst his routine of tidying up. Emma, from the isolated interior of a sound-proofed booth, lent her ears diligently to already recorded tracks, pouring over them for any room for improvement. Being lost in the music was her way of paying homage to her craft - an unspoken ritual she followed each time she embarked on a music production journey. The entirety of her focus was consumed by the musical notes and rhythm filtering through the studio speakers.\n\nConcurrently, Ricky was absorbed in the act of playing his guitar. His fingers navigated deftly over the strings, lost in an intimate dance with the instrument. As he played, the melodic strums reverberated throughout the studio, filling it with an infectious pulse that hinted at the birth of yet another musical masterpiece. Despite the flurry of activity around him, Ricky was lost in a world of his own, operating on a singular vision of delivering his best performance.\n\nIn the meantime, Danny was continuing his cautious management of the studio, ensuring that everything fell into place for the optimum recording session. His watchful eyes were scanning every corner, taking stock of the minor details that could impact the session. However, the design of the studio didn't allow for an unrestricted view into all the corners. The sound booth, where Emma was engrossed in her work, was out of his visual range. The seclusion provided by the booth, although crucial for immersive work, also acted as a barrier for Danny's comprehensive vigilance.\n\nAs the day progressed, the studio was entwined in a concerted symphony of dedication and workmanship, the trio, each engrossed in their pursuit, working together to create the best version of Ricky's impending album. As the final note of the day rang through the studio, each person revelled in the satisfaction of another day done right, another step closer towards the realization of Ricky's artistic vision.\n\nWithin the dynamic dance of the day's events, the relationships of the trio sang a compelling tune. Each individual played their crucial part in the creation of the impending masterpiece - Ricky with his raw talent, Emma with her passion for perfection, and Danny with his meticulous eye for detail. And as the lights faded on another day of creation, they could sense the beginning of an important chapter in their artistry, a silence collecting the scattered notes of the day, signing off on another critical step in the journey of Ricky's upcoming album.", "questions": [{"question": "Which location is the most likely place Danny would look to find the earphones given the story?", "answer": 1, "choices": ["piano", "producer's desk", "recording booth"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "A worn, leather-bound notebook contains all of Ricky's song lyrics, a crucial piece for his upcoming studio session.", "children": [{"value": "opening scene", "children": [{"value": "Danny sees the notebook at the producer's desk.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Danny sees the earphones at the recording booth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Emma sees the notebook at the producer's desk.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Emma sees the earphones at the recording booth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Ricky sees the notebook at the producer's desk.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Ricky sees the earphones at the recording booth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": false}, {"value": "Ricky moves the notebook to the piano.

He keeps it conveniently placed in the cockpit, within arm\u2019s reach. Lisa, with the same dedication to the job, ensures that the safety booklet is tucked away in storage for quick access. Tom, the copilot, is always ready to assist Richard, familiar with the careful locations of the flight manual and safety booklet. Their tireless commitment to safety and preparedness was evident; everyone was aware, ready, and knew exactly where the crucial objects were located.\n\nWith a disciplined stride, Richard carries the flight manual to his office. Placing it down, he feels a sense of satisfaction, knowing he can review and improve his protocol knowledge at his leisure. Despite the din of commotion around her, flight attendant, Lisa, was caught up in instructing a fresh recruit on the necessity of excellent beverage service, ensuring that passenger comfort was meticulously addressed. In tandem with this, pilot Richard left the vicinity, clutching something tightly as he intrepidly ventured forth. With a show of respect for his partner's goal of constant preparation, Tom, the reliable copilot was closely following Richard, heading in the same direction. All actions undeniably affirmed their unwavering commitment to safety, readiness, and flawless execution of cabin operations.\n\n\nSlipping the flight manual under his arm, Tom headed straight toward the cockpit. His determined footsteps echoed his intent - another successful and incident-free flight. Whilst Richard found himself deeply engrossed in a task elsewhere, Lisa was indulging a passenger in pleasant banter, discussing their travel experiences. The hums of the conversation did little to fill the vast distance that separated Lisa and the engaged passenger from Tom and Richard. Lisa's laughter, dancing on the edge of the lively chatter within the aircraft, signaled her absorption in the conversation.\n\nSimultaneously, Tom navigated the plane, making his move amid the quiet of lesser trodden areas of the aircraft. His path, charted away from the watchful gaze of Richard, led him back to the heart of operation - the cockpit. \n\n\nUnbroken strides took Lisa towards the passengers seating area, a bundle of safety booklets firmly clutched against her chest. The leak of anticipation curled up around her lips as she began resupplying each seat, ready to welcome new passengers onboard. At the same time, Lisa, with her trademark charm, was diligently restocking the passenger seating area. Her hands swiftly moved in rhythm, ensuring that all was in order and ready for the hopeful passengers about to embark on their journey. Meanwhile, Richard, consistent with his role as the meticulous pilot, was thoroughly engrossed in the pre-flight checks located in another section of the plane. Despite not being in the same vicinity, Lisa and Richard's dedication to duty created a seamless link between the front and back of the aircraft.\n\nElsewhere, Tom, the faithful copilot, was discussing painstaking flight procedures with Richard. Their commitment to precise execution was evident in the quiet confidence that reverberated along with their diligent pace. Their work was choreographed like an unobserved ballet, an underpinning rhythm of safety and reliability in the background. As the trio ventured forth in their tasks, an unseen thread of unwavering readiness connected them, even with the distance that separated them physically. Their concentrated efforts in different sectors of the plane echoed a well-tuned rhythm of safety that reverberated throughout.

Motivated by her cravings for discoveries, her eyes were distracted by the precious ancient coin, discovered with care, held firmly in the grasp of earth. Her assistant Tom, just a laborer with an ambition of a career in archeology, worked diligently at the marked areas, covertly observing Martha\u2019s every movement. On the other hand, Jenny, the recent graduate and enthusiastic volunteer, was eager to aid in the excavation in any way she could.\n\nThe magnifying glass was at reach, inside the well-equipped excavation kit, radiant under the scorching sun, vital for Martha\u2019s meticulous inspection of any artifact. A collective understanding among them about the location of each tool was inherent. After all, in the vast realm of an excavation site, chaos was not spared a location.\n\nQuickly, Martha rushed to the well-equipped excavation kit, snatching the magnifying glass and moving it over to the inspection area. The glass glistened under the sun as she handled it with a sense of urgency, her eyes eager to delve into the secrets the ancient coin held within. Meanwhile, Tom found himself drawn to an unearthed piece of pottery, a treasured find from the burial of the sands. Paying intense attention, he studied the object in his hands, both unfamiliar and uncanny. It was remarkably similar to a specimen he had seen in a textbook during his aspirations for a more academic role in archeology.\n\nIn tandem, Jenny keenly observed Martha, standing a little off to the side, helping when directed, her eyes darting between Martha's skilled handling of the artifacts and Tom's steady digging. The underway operation was a captivating orchestration of trowels, brushes, and screens, capturing not just their interest but their collective dedication to the archaeological process.\n\nHandling the coin delicately, Tom passed it to the inspection area with a sense of apprehension, hoping not to damage the piece of antiquity. Upon moving it there, his gaze stumbled upon the magnifying glass, carelessly placed right beside the coin. Amid the day's work at the excavation site, the coordinated hustle of the team was a sight to behold. Martha found herself assisting Tom in his meticulous digging, the rhythm of their collaboration undisturbed even in the face of looming weather. Each scoop of the earth bore the potential of concealed history, and Tom, driven by his aspirations, savored every moment under Martha's tutelage.\n\nWhile they worked, Jenny busied herself too. A role often overlooked by spectators of the archeological process, she was tasked with securing the excavation site from the upcoming brutal winds. Together with Martha, she was setting up a windbreaker at a spot quite a ways from Tom. The positioning was strategic, as the key was to protect unearthed finds from the wrestling winds without hindering ongoing excavations. \n\nTom continued his endeavor, engrossed in his work. Guided by Martha's seasoned hand and watchful eyes, he held the responsibility of navigating the layers of historic dust with utmost precision. It was a balancing act of digging swiftly and carefully, all the while keeping an eye on the unfolding mysteries that lay beneath. \n\nEvery movement counted, every breath held a sense of anticipation. The rhythm of the excavation flowed in smooth patterns, the story of times long gone slowly revealing itself through the sandy canvas beneath their feet.\n\nPost Martha's inspection, Jenny carefully picked up the magnifying glass and moved it back to its designated pocket in the excavation kit; preserving it safe and sound for future use. In the prime of the sun, the looming threat of rain hung heavily in the air. Martha, the archaeologist, found it difficult to shift her focus from the hidden relics which lay beneath the ground. Offering a helping hand, laborer Tom dug into the marked areas while stealing glances at Martha, planning his future steps in the world of archeology. On the sidelines, fresh graduate, Jenny, observed the unfolding fervor with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\n\nAn indispensable accessory was housed within the excavation kit, untouched under the glaring sun, awaited movement of Martha's hand for further evaluation of the precious artifacts. Their synergy was crucial in navigating the intricate world of excavation. After all, disorder had no place amidst the sands and relics.\n\nMartha sought the unseen accessory with a sense of urgency. Swiftly, she moved it over to the inspection area; the accessory sparkled under the fervid sunshine, looking ready for the duties it was to perform. Concurrently, a small artifact, hidden beneath the layers of sand, caught Tom's attention. To him, the piece looked oddly familiar, he had seen something similar in the textbooks during his early days in archaeology.\n\nIn the meantime, Jenny maintained a close watch on Martha, ready to help wherever needed. The tools of labor moved rhythmically across the site, each serving a purpose in the ongoing process of archaeological excavation.\n\nTom handled the newly discovered artifact with caution, understanding its fragility and the historical importance it held. He presented it to Martha for further inspection. Seeing the important accessory resting beside, brought forth a realization of the coordinated nature of the team's efforts. Under Martha's guidance, he continued on his voyage of the buried past. Every scoop of soil was a step into the depths of history, leaving him all the more absorbed in his pursuit of archeology.\n\nWhile Tom was lost in his world, Jenny was tasked with an important responsibility, that of protecting the excavation site from the predicted winds. Working in unity with Martha, she erected a windbreaker at a safe distance from Tom's ongoing excavation. The effort was directed towards impeding the winds from affecting the unearthed artifacts but not hindering their efforts.\n\nTom, under Martha's watchful eyes, continued to decipher the concealed stories within the layers of earthly time. The exercise demanded the finesse of swift yet careful investigation, all the while unveiling the hidden chapters of history.\n\nEach movement held significance, each revelation fostered a sense of accomplishment. As they moved the sands, time seemed to rewind, piecing together the long-forgotten narratives of human civilization right beneath their feet.\n\nAt the end of her inspection, Jenny carefully placed back the accessory into its pocket in the kit, ensuring its safekeeping for further adventures. The excavations were suspended for the day, as the team wrapped up, looking forward to the newer discoveries that awaited them. As the light fell and the winds hushed, the site turned into a silent theatre, routing the dreams of secrets soon to be unraveled.", "questions": [{"question": "Which location is the most likely place Jenny would look to find the ancient coin given the story?", "answer": 0, "choices": ["Earth", "Excavation kit", "Inspection area"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "The archaeologist Martha, needs her magnifying glass to inspect the ancient artifacts at the site.", "children": [{"value": "opening scene", "children": [{"value": "Jenny sees the Magnifying glass at the Excavation kit.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Jenny sees the Ancient coin at the Earth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Martha sees the Magnifying glass at the Excavation kit.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Martha sees the Ancient coin at the Earth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Tom sees the Magnifying glass at the Excavation kit.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Tom sees the Ancient coin at the Earth.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": false}, {"value": "Martha moves the Magnifying glass to the Inspection area.

Each orchestrated in this symphony of chaotic beauty, well-aware of their surroundings and the items cast in this narrative.\n\nDavid, never seen without the key to the lion's cage that usually resided in a little box, stood stunned as he found its usual home empty. The key was no longer in its spot in the box, an abnormality that hitched his breath a tad but couldn't stifle his seasoned proficiency. It was but a hiccup in his otherwise immaculate day.\n\nEmma, adorned with sunglasses perched atop her head, had a sense of enchantment about her, one that was amplified by her presence in the zoo. Her mind painted wonderful, wild pictures of what lay beyond the barriers of the animal exhibits, hinting at her adventurousness. She wanted to get as close to the animals as possible, to see them without the veil of spectators flitting between her and her curiosity.\n\nWith each pair of eyes watching, George was trying his level best, striving to quell the cacophony of fresh responsibilities echoing in his head. As the newest zookeeper in the bunch, he was anxious to show he could juggle everything that came his way.\n\nA summer day at the zoo, the scene was set, and everyone knew their parts. The key, the box, the sunglasses, each in their assigned place, ready to come alive in the imaginative sweep of events to follow.\n\nNewly vested with responsibilities, George gripped the lion cage key, shifting it from its usual spot in the conspicuously empty box, to the solitude of the zookeeper's office. He wanted to review the locking mechanisms in tranquility, eager to familiarize himself with each cage's unique lock sequence. Simultaneously, David found himself having a conversation about the zoo's emergency plans with George, their discussion bringing a moment of calm amidst the zoo's typically busy atmosphere. George, ever earnest, was seen entering the office with a gleaming metallic object cradled in his hand. \n\nFar removed from where the tranquil discussion was taking place, Emma was absorbed in the fascinating world of elephants. The information board, standing a good distance from the office, did an excellent job of satiating her curiosity for the time being. Each line of information about the gargantuan creatures was a doorway to another world for her, drawing her further into the zoo's enchantment.\n\nEmbracing the shadowy comfort of the tree canopy, Emma slid her sunglasses off her glowing face and into the sanctuary of her bag. Her eyes, now free to dance with the sun-speckled foliage, reveled in the raw beauty of the zoo around her. Mustering experience and calm, David was sequestered inside the reptile house, attending an unexpected situation that had arose. One could almost hear the hissing and slithering encircling him, an ambiance indicative of the location's residents. Close by, the lion's cage seemed to echo with a growing unease, the missing metallic accessory from the box becoming a soundless yet significant detail in the unfolding day.\n\nElsewhere, encompassed in rustic colors and rich aromas of the zoo, George was diligently occupied. His task had led him to the far end of the park away from the pulsing visitor's area, ensuring the animal feed was replenished and up to his meticulous standards. The feed storage, probably one of the lesser glamorous parts of the zoo, was bustling with activity, George's sole focus centering on the endeavor to ace his assignment.\n\nThe zoo, teeming with wild, unscripted beauty, and expectations of a rewarding day, was a symphony of sights and sounds, the humming activity interlacing with our characters' individual stories.\n\nRealizing the potential danger, David quickly retrieved the key from the office and returned it securely to the box. The symbolic clinking sound of metal against wood echoed in his ears, a small reassurance of safety restored amidst the zoo's cacophony. Amidst the myriad sights and sounds of what was to become an unforgettable day at the zoo, every individual - from seasoned zookeeper to wide-eyed visitor - played a crucial role in the unraveled narrative.\n\nThe ever-vigilant David, de facto custodian of safety for both beast and man, found his resolute countenance sufficiently perturbed at the disrupting discovery of an missing item. A fanatical stickler for order, David was momentarily unmoored at finding the designated box bare.\n\nUnfettered by any such professional concerns was Emma, her spirit of adventure stoked by the array of beasts that surrounded her. An entire array of parrots fluttering around her, each one adding to the cacophony that was, all at once, chaotic and joyously harmonious.\n\nAll while George, the rookie in charge of aquatic life, diligently tended to the inhabitants of the aquarium. Behind the thick glass separation, he was an engrossed figure, captivated by the teeming underwater life on display.\n\nSituated at a polar opposite end from David was the interaction session. Emma, in her gusto to feel the thrilling sensation of a live parrot perching on her, was lost in a world of her own. The colors of their feathers were as myriad as the curiosities darting in and out of her mind.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the riot of tropical hues and raucous squawking, David's panic began to recede, and one could see the cogs of his mind whirring as he navigated the problem methodically.

His wife, Maria, also worried about their treasure, yearned for an invincible sense of safety within their abode. To secure their precious item, they employed Luke, an unequivocally trustworthy security officer who bore the responsibility of safeguarding their prosperous home. All three were privy to the location of the stairway accessing the cellar, as well as every detail pertaining to it. A notepad lay casually on the kitchen counter; vital for jotting down security schedules and monitoring shifts, while the precious keys, indispensable for accessing the golden trove, were tucked away discreetly on the nightstand, a spot familiar to all. Everyone knew the significance and existence of these objects and were well aware of their strategic locations. The house hummed quietly with a tangible tension, each person carrying the weight of responsibility for the protection of the hidden gold.\n\nRemembering the notepad left on the kitchen counter, Luke moved swiftly but unobtrusively to retrieve it. With a twinge of relief, he placed it back on the safety of his security desk, preparing to document his ongoing vigilance of the golden hoard. In the meantime, Henry secluded himself within the depths of their cellar, ensuring the gold was still in place where he had left it earlier. He found comfort and distraction within the cosy confines of the cellar from all his tensions. Maria, engrossed in pampering and comforting him, accompanied him, validating his concerns and soothing his unsettled mind with her reassuring presence. The cellar itself was at an arm's length from the main building, a secluded space, providing both an additional layer of separation and protection against any unwanted attention. Around them, their home kept its existing rhythm; their conversation, while of utmost importance to Maria and Henry, was isolated; Luke's standpoint was a whole other space away from them.\n\nIn a quiet act of caution, Maria moved the crucial keys from their visible resting place on the nightstand to a more concealed location - a seldom used kitchen drawer. Simultaneously, Henry and Maria were in each other's company, navigating through the whirlpool of their anxieties and concerns. Duty-bound and vigilant, Luke was elsewhere, engrossed in fortifying the security of the property's boundaries, carrying out his routine checks meticulously. An air of quiet efficiency emanated from him as he rotated between various parts of the property ensuring all was in order. All this while, Maria executed her precautionary move well within Henry's view, her actions merging with the sombre rhythm of their softly nurtured anxieties.\n\nWith a careful, deliberate motion, Henry transferred the keys from their conspicuous place to the hidden sanctuary of a safety deposit box. Recognizing this as a formidable strategy for securing their gold, he felt a twinge of satisfaction, confident in the additional layer of protection this action provided. Henry, alone in the cellar's dim light, requested Luke to secure the house boundaries against unexpected threats. As a trustworthy security officer, Luke moved to action immediately, stepping faithfully into the chilly air outside the house. Simultaneously, Maria busied herself upstairs, her words floating in a hushed hum through a phone conversation. Their home was a labyrinth of quiet activity, as everyone was busy ensuring the safety and security of the valuable possession hidden in the depths of the cellar. As these events unfolded in their own time, a tapestry of shared concern and focused attention was woven in the house. \n\nWith the final deliberate movement, the conclusion of Henry's careful action printed a satisfied smile on his face. It was the silent music of a well-played strategy, an additional layer of protection fixed in place. His gold was safe. Their home was safe. And with the echoes of shared responsibilities and overlapping pseudonyms of a quiet afternoon, the story of their day found its closure. In their world of golden silence, the day's end came with the confirmed reality of secured gold, and a reassured night's sleep for Henry, Maria, and Luke.", "questions": [{"question": "Which location is the most likely place Henry would look to find the notepad given the story?", "answer": 0, "choices": ["kitchen", "kitchen drawer", "nightstand", "safety deposit box", "security desk"], "intermediate_trees": [{"chance_of_or": 0.0, "depth": 3, "chance_to_prune": 0.0, "chance_to_prune_all": 0.0, "bf_factor": {"2": 1.0}, "deduction_type_sample_rate": {"syllogism": 1.0}, "root_structure": [{"value": "Henry's ton of gold is stored in the cellar, he cannot risk moving it.", "children": [{"value": "opening scene", "children": [{"value": "Henry sees the notepad at the kitchen.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Henry sees the keys at the nightstand.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Luke sees the notepad at the kitchen.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Luke sees the keys at the nightstand.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Maria sees the notepad at the kitchen.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}, {"value": "Maria sees the keys at the nightstand.", "children": [], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": true}], "fact_type": "explicit", "operator": "or", "constraints": [], "deduction_type": null, "prunable": false, "can_be_leaf": false}, {"value": "Luke moves the notepad to the security desk.

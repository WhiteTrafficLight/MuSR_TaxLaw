[{"context": "Following are two different tax law cases for similar transaction type.\n\nCase 1:\nIn the fiscal year under review, it has been noted that all meeting minutes have been duly stored in the database of Zeta Enterprises GmbH, a firm primarily engaged in the provision of IT consulting and software development services. Records reveal that these services, as per the established agreement, were provided in return for periodically assessed charges.\n\nThroughout the fiscal year, the records exhibit a notable pattern of the parent company holding strategic decision-making responsibilities over the operations of Zeta Enterprises GmbH, as evidenced by extensive documentation of parent company board meetings. These documents show that within said period, decisions pertaining to five major market expansions for the Germany-based entity were executed at the parent company level.\n\nA detailed review of the minutes from the board meetings at the parent level, during the same period, suggests a comprehensive decision-making process. Each set of minutes includes a list of attendees, presiding agenda items, key discussion points, as well as outcomes of deliberated decisions.\n\nFor the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 20, examination of the Zeta Enterprises GmbH's regional headquarters' meeting minutes showed no recorded strategic decisions. This indicates limited decision-making autonomy within the regional entity during this period.\n\nLooking at the firm's expansion activity within the fiscal year 2019-2020, it emerged that the local team of Zeta Enterprises GmbH initiated three new, but not novel, market expansions—all within existing markets previously active in the company's portfolio, as opposed to those dictated by the parent entity.\n\nThe audit of Zeta Enterprises GmbH's filings to Finanzamt München, within procedural timelines, acknowledge the inclusion of a strategic planning document. Within this document, sections detailing a market analysis, financial projections and risk considerations were evidently present.\n\nPlease note that all presented facts above are for the consideration of the court, and were derived from the review of documents and records corresponding to the fiscal year under scrutiny.\n\nCase 2:\nIt was established that Konzern Deutschland AG submitted the report through the official digital medium of the Bundesamt für Justiz before the prescribed submission date. Examination of financial records indicated that management fees for the corporation were remitted on a quarterly basis, with no relation to the frequency or intensity of strategic decision-making events.\n\nA detailed analysis prepared by the taxpayer was present in the records. The document provided a detailed overview of the shareholder engagements and the services extended during each quarter of the respective fiscal year. The absence of a direct correlation between the corporation's participation and the initiation of strategies in the minutes from the meetings held in Q1-Q4 2021 was noted upon review.\n\nThe full documentation, which outlined the nature and extent of services, was submitted on a digital platform under the Bundesamt für Justiz ahead of the stipulated cut-off date. Within the submitted materials, a thorough breakdown of services rendered and distribution among recipient entities for the fiscal year of 2021 was accounted for. The case remains under the preview of § 15 of the Income Tax Act, which governs the interpretation of cost allocation key for centralized services.", "questions": [{"question": "Which case is more

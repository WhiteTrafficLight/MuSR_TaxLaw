[{"context": "Following are two different tax law cases for similar transaction type.\n\nCase 1:\nIn the case before the court, the entity in question is Nordwind KG, a firm engaged in the sector of legal consulting and law firm activities. Records show that the firm submitted an advance pricing agreement (APA) request to the Landesfinanzministerium Bayern, specifically on the 28th day following the receipt of the form from the tax authorities.\n\nThe documents reveal that the intellectual property (IP) licensing agreement under Nordwind KG's arrangement is established between two related entities from different European Union member states. According to the terms specified in the licensing agreement, license fees are to be paid in arrears on a bi-annual basis, and these payments are exempt from withholding tax on the license fees payable.\n\nAs showcased in Nordwind KG's strategic records, during the fiscal year 2022, the firm undertook 15 new market development initiatives. Analysis of the firm's fourth quarter financial report indicates that these efforts contributed to a 5% increase in overall revenue within the reporting period.\n\nAn examination of the firm's financial accounts reveals that 80% of the total revenue for fiscal 2022 was derived from fees accrued for the licensing of mature software products. Documetary evidence suggests that these software products, a central revenue source, were originally devised by the parent company of Nordwind KG which maintains the intellectual property rights to them.\n\nIn complying with procedural requirements, Nordwind KG included in its APA request an analysis of 10 licenses that were found to be of comparable nature in terms of their software type and sector of business. The relevant legislative framework stipulates that such an APA request should be submitted within a maximum of 30 days from receipt of the relevant form from the tax authorities. In adherence to this, Nordwind KG submitted the detailed comparable analysis within the permitted timeframe.\n\nCase 2:\nUpon examination, it was determined that Metropol Enterprises AG entered into a contractual agreement regarding intellectual property usage rights with its affiliate situated in the Netherlands. Terms within the agreement delineate 'embedded royalties' as a peculiar class of payments. The records show the dispute pertains to the characterization of these payments as 'embedded royalties' in the context of Article 12 of the Germany-Netherlands Tax Treaty.\n\nThe documentation reveals that in the last fiscal year, Metropol Enterprises AG secured agreements with new entities, out of amongst these contracts, 65.7% were executed with entities formerly under a license agreement with the parent company. A scrutiny of the company's sales logs indicates that the firm cultivated an operational relationship with a mere 8 new clients on its own during the same time. As the records elucidate, a significant number of new contracts, amounting to 60, were brought into the firm by pre-existing licensees from the parent company.\n\nContrastingly, only five new businesses were added to Metropol Enterprises AG's clientele throughout the prior fiscal year. No records of intellectual property inspections were encompassed in the transaction documents. Reports of such inspections documented in the submitted files were found to be unorganized without a chronological order, as evidenced by the dates attached to each report.\n\nProcedurally, the intellectual property valuation report was not contemporaneous with the initial transaction. The company's corporate records show that it was completed and submitted 18 months post the initiation of the agreement. Additionally, there appears to be an absence of dated evidence indicating corresponding price negotiations at the time of the transaction.\n\nThe point of contention resides in Metropol Enterprises AG's assertion that these so-called 'embedded royalties' do not fall within the scope of royalty payments as defined by Article 12 of the Germany-Netherlands Tax Treaty, as articulated in the submitted dispute files.", "questions": [{"question": "Which case is more likely to be accepted?", "choices": ["A) Case 1", "B) Case 2"], "answer": 0, "intermediate_trees": [[{"chance_of_or": 0.0,

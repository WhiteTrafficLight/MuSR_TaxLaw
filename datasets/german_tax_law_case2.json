[{"context": "Following are two different tax law cases for similar transaction type.\n\nCase 1:\nIt was established that TechStart Innovation UG undertook a transfer of certain functions, comprising the management of power grid connectivity, optimizing energy efficiency, and integrating renewable energy sources. As part of this transfer, the operation of these functions was directed from Germany to multiple foreign entities.\n\nUpon examination of the operational setup, it was revealed that the company maintains a customer service hub, staffed by thirty full-time employees. Records indicate that these individuals are proficient in several languages, including German, English, Spanish, and Italian. Further, the records show that personnel work in shifts to cater to various time zones, each having completed a robust training course pertaining to their respective geographic area's energy guidelines and client needs.\n\nDuring 2025, it was documented that local staff successfully guided clients through more than 200 updates of regulatory nature in their corresponding markets without infractions being reported. The company provided in-depth information on the energy dynamics of each jurisdiction to which functions were transferred, as well as its respective environmental regulations. \n\nRelating to procedural matters, the company executed a notification of business restructuring well ahead of the stipulated 16-week minimum period, as prescribed by German tax law. Said notification contained comprehensive details relating to the functions anticipated to be transferred, including schematic representations of the planned distribution among foreign entities. Further, the notification elaborated on provisions to maintain an uninterrupted energy supply during the transitional period.\n\nCustomer satisfaction metrics for the year under review, being specifically the fourth quarter of 2025, demonstrate a resolution rate of 90% for queries within the initial twenty-four hours. Detailed analysis of the transferred roles revealed that not all receiving foreign entities possessed experience or related expertise.\n\nIn summary, all the findings indicate that a series of unique functions related to power grid connectivity, energy efficiency optimization, and renewable energy integrations were transferred to different foreign entities by TechStart Innovation UG.\n\nCase 2:\nIt has been established in the course of the review of the facts of the case that Gamma Innovations UG, operating in the energy supply and renewable energy sector, implemented a business restructuring. This restructuring saw a major function of Gamma Innovations UG being transferred from its central unit to a distribution center. Precisely, the function pertaining to the logistics calculus and the distribution of renewable energy projects underwent a shift in operation locus.\n\nThe records review indicates that the distribution center processed over 15,000 shipments related to renewable energy projects in the past fiscal year. It is worthy of note that the quantity of shipments handled by the distribution center witnessed a 50% increase, rising from 10,000 to 15,000 within a single fiscal year.\n\nAn examination of operational data over a three-year period reveals a progressively rising turnover at the distribution center, with an average annual increase of 20%. These operations involved the movement of more than 500 metric tons of inbound and outbound goods per operational day.\n\nDespite the transfer of a significant function to the distribution center, it was identified that Gamma Innovations UG retained strategic control over general business operations. Furthermore, it was found that the distribution center, whilst part of Gamma Innovations UG, operated autonomously in executing its day-to-day activities.\n\nA notable omission in provided documentation was that the specific valuation associated with the transferred function was absent. Moreover, a detailed logistical routing protocol, a key component in the analysis of the function transfer, was not made available in the submitted records.\n\nIt has been established through the study of the communication trail, or the lack thereof, that Gamma Innovations UG did not proactively inform the Finanzgericht Hamburg of the initiated business restructuring. It was during an unrelated audit, carried out by the Finanzgericht Hamburg, that the said restructuring was uncovered.\n\nThe revision of documents and reassessment of events have been conducted according to the protocols ushered by § 1 of the Foreign Tax Act. The procedural actions and expansions undertaken by Gamma Innovations UG are currently under analysis within this legislative context.", "questions": [{"question": "Which case is more likely to be
